# Objectives
- using sample function to take random sample
- loading packages in R markdown without messages
- loading images in R markdown --> ![](imagename.ext)

# Statistical Concepts
- random samples will produce a different set of values every time
- can use and R function to keep one random sample
- sample prop good estimate for population prop
- how sample size effects standard error

# R Concepts/Syntax
- use the sample() function to take a random sample of your dataset
- use set.seed() to keep one one random sample
- can assign names to random sample with <- 
- displaying values in the sample
- use message = FALSE as an arguement in R chunk to load mosaic package but leave out the messages
- can load images in html files with ![](imagename.ext)

# DataCamp Course Outline
- how to use the sample() function
- using set.seed(number) to have a fixed random sample
- show how random sample statistic is similar to population (sample proportion is a good estimate of population proportion)
- take larger sample and compare mean and sd (show as n increases, standard error decreases)
- using R as a calculator to find confidence intervals
- syntax for uploading images (multiple choice)
