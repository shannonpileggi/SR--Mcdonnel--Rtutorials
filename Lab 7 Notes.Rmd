# Objectives
- use one sample z-test for single proportion
- two sample z-test for two proportions
- use chi-sq to test for association between two categorical vars
- calculating p-values from test statistics

# Statistical Concepts
- to test proportions, use z-tests
- one sample z-test statistic is equal to the x^2 statistic
- two sample z-test is used when testing 2 categorical variables

# R Concepts/Syntax
- examining categorical variables with the table() function
- use addmargins() around the table to get totals
- use prop.test() for one sample z-tests
- use prop.test for 2 sample z-test with c() function added


# DataCamp Course Outline
- get a data set with all categorical variables

# Questions
- Will you always use z-test for proportions and t-test for means?
- Need help with getting a open intro data set about NC birth records into datacamp... smoker/nonsmoker and premie/healthy. I want to use this for the 2 sample z-test
- I can use the source() function to import other open intro data but for some reason not this one
# Notes
- all variables in the data set are categorical
