# Objectives
- use one sample z-test for single proportion
- two sample z-test for two proportions
- chi-squared test of association
- calculating p-values from test statistics

# Statistical Concepts
- to test proportions, use z-tests
- one sample z-test statistic is equal to the x^2 statistic
- two sample z-test is used when testing 2 categorical variables
- use chi-sq to test for association between 2 categorical vars (one binary and other with more than 2 levels)

# R Concepts/Syntax
- examining categorical variables with the table() function
- use addmargins() around the table to get totals
- use prop.test() for one sample z-tests
- use prop.test for 2 sample z-test with c() function added
- chisq.test() for chi-squared with correct = F

# DataCamp Course Outline
- get a data set with all categorical variables
- Start with one sample z, then 2 sample, the chi-squared
- add in most of the quiz questions


# Questions
- The hypotheses and conclusion for the chi-squared test is missing on the lab manual...do you want it in there?
- I don't see any assumptions for the z-tests... should I add questions on the assumptions in the DataCamp course?
- Should I add a slide on the prop.table() function? I feel like it may do more harm than good because of the 'margin' arguement.

# Notes
- all variables in the data set are categorical
- The data for the chi-squared test is a little inappropriate but it's fun and exciting! Now I kinda have too many drug/smoking related questions but those are the ones that are interesting for students but I'll go back and change earlier questions regarding that stuff.
