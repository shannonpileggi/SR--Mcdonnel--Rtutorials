## Summer Research, 2017

### _Student:_ Tessa Mcdonnel
### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi

### Objective
Improve upon existing STAT 217 labs in R by creating a community data camp course that accompanies the labs.

### Specific Aims
1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.
2.  Write all R code according to Hadley Wickam's Style Guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).  All R code should be written in a reproducible manner, such that code will execute when applied to a new data set. 
3.  Thoroughly explore the iFixit Answer's forum in conjunction with the data to understand what the data represents.
