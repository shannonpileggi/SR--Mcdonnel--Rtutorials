## Summer Research, 2017

### _Student:_ Tessa Mcdonnel
### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi

### Objective
Improve upon existing STAT 217 labs in R by creating a community data camp course that accompanies the labs.

### Specific Aims
1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.
2.  Write all R code according to Hadley Wickam's Style Guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).  All R code should be written in a reproducible manner, such that code will execute when applied to a new data set. 
3.  Review existing STAT 217 lab materials on PolyLearn.  Complete all 9 labs (read lab manual, watch pre-lab videos, take pre-lab quiz, and complete lab practice).
4.  Take the Data Analysis and Statistical Inference course on Data Camp (https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis#gs.e43W=KU)
5.  Create a similar Data Camp community course specific to STAT 217 to replace pre-lab assignments (https://www.datacamp.com/teach/).
6.  Create a quick R reference guide that contains essential information learned in each lab assignment.
