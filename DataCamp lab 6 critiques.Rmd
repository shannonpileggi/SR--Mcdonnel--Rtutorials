### Lab 6

###### Two sample t-test

* I'm still having trouble with the subscripts... Weston gave me a few suggestions but they didnt work.

###### Summarizing Tukey plots
* I dont understand the last comment... where do you want me to state that?


###### Comments
* it is super long... but this lab has so much good stuff! We could definitely take some stuff out


### Lab 7

* for one-sample z-test, what is the last comment? (In the R script...)
